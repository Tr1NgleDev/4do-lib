# 4DO-Lib [WIP]
A header-only library for loading and constructing 4DO Geometry files.

Based on the [4DO Geometry File Format Specification v1](https://github.com/HoxelDraw/4DO-Specification/tree/spec-version-1)

## Goals:
- Make a complete implementation of the 4DO File Format Specification.
- Create an optimized binary variant of the format.
