# 4DO-Lib
A header-only C++20 library for loading and constructing 4DO Geometry files.  
With a bit of 4D Math thrown in.

Based on the [4DO Geometry File Format Specification v1](https://github.com/HoxelDraw/4DO-Specification/tree/spec-version-1)

## Goals:
- [x] Make a complete implementation of the 4DO File Format Specification.
- [x] .4do file loading.
- [x] .4do file construction/creation and saving.
- [x] Tetrahedralization function to make the data usable for rendering.
- [ ] Create an optimized binary variant of the format.

Check [examples](./examples) for examples.
